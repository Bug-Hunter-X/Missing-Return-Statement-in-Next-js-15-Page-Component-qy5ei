# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: forgetting to include a return statement in a page component.  This can lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement. This will cause Next.js 15 to throw an error.

## Solution

The `pages/about.js` file has been updated to include a `return` statement, resolving the error.  Always ensure your page components have a `return` statement to render content.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see an error in your browser's developer console if you haven't corrected the bug.
